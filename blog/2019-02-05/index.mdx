I just went through one of the most challenging aspects if this build so far - getting new ignition keys created. I thought it was going to be simple. I pulled the ignition
cylinder off the bike and took it to Baldino's Lock & Key. They didn't have the key blanks and weren't sure which ones would fit so they gave me some codes and I ordered
them from Ebay.

These did not work:

- Ilco HO41
- DL HD41
- Curtis HD67
- Ilco HD36

The good thing that came out of that effort was learning the right code - **Silca HON36**. We couldn't find the blank anywhere in the U.S. but I eventually found a UK company <http://www.keytrader.co.uk/>.
If you're in the U.S. you can't order through their website but you can just send them an email. They were very responsive and friendly. After 1 week I got the key blanks, took them
to Baldino's and they were finally able to make the replacement keys. This entire effort took me about a month to get squared away.

Just remember, if you need a Silca HON36 key blank for your Honda S90, CT90, CL90 then just go straight to <http://www.keytrader.co.uk/>.
